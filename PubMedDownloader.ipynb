In partnership with Kind Campus, a widely adopted school-based kindness education program that uses a bottom-up program framework, a methodology called concept mapping was used to develop a conceptual model for evaluating school-based kindness education programs from the input of 123 middle school students and approximately 150 educators, school professionals, and academic scholars. From the basis of this model, recommendations for processes and outcomes that would be useful to assess in evaluations of kindness education programs are made, and areas where additional instrument development may be necessary are highlighted.

We aimed to assess the relationship between the TG/HDL-C ratio and insulin resistance (IR) and its usefulness in prediction of the metabolic syndrome (MS). This retrospective study involved 122 obese children with the mean age of 11.63 years and their 58 healthy lean peers. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, the plasma lipid profile and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were analyzed. Based on the obtained results, the TG/HDL-C ratio and surrogate insulin resistance indices (HOMA-IR, FGIR, QUICKI, OGIS, Matsuda index) were calculated. The TG/HDL-C ratio positively correlated with weight, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), lipid profile, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin and insulin measurements during OGTT, and negatively correlated with FGIR, QUICKI, OGIS, and the Matsuda index. Obese children with the TG/HDL-C ratio3 (47.5%) had higher values of WHR and HOMA-IR, and lower ones of FGIR, QUICKI, OGIS, and the Matsuda index when compared to their obese peers with the TG/HDL-C<3. The area under the curve (AUC) calculated for each insulin resistance index in prediction of the metabolic syndrome was the largest for the TG/HDL-C ratio (0.8936, 95% Cl:0.809-0.977, p=0.000). For 1 unit increase in the TG/HDL-C ratio, the odds for having MS increased by 2.09 times. The TG/HDL-C ratio is a good surrogate marker of insulin resistance in obese children.

It is the most common primary neoplasm of the liver and often arises in the context of a chronic liver disease that impairs coagulation. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication of HCC that is associated with a poor prognosis. Heparin derivatives are widely used in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Among them low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) favorably influences the survival in patients with advanced cancer, including HCC. Due to their pleiotropic function, heparins affect tumorigenesis in many ways and may promote or hamper tumorigenic transformation depending on the cancer type and cancer stage along with their structural properties and concentration. Thus, their application as an antithrombotic along with the conventional therapy regime should be carefully planned to develop the best management strategies. In this review, we first will briefly review clinical applications of heparin derivatives in the management of cancer with a particular focus on HCC. We then summarize the state of knowledge whereby heparin can crosstalk with molecules playing a role in hepatocarcinogenesis.

After the introduction of Ae. albopictus in Greece, urban areas have been considered to be at risk of epidemic arboviral outbreaks and identifying effective control strategies is imperative. Our study examines the relationship between mosquito breeding sources and socioeconomic or demographic characteristics of different households in a Greek municipality and evaluates efficacy of resident education. The results revealed that only a minority of residents knew where mosquitoes breed (18.6%) and only 46% felt that residents had any responsibility for managing breeding habitat.
