They review the limited literature on medical student suicide and suggest that no comprehensive study has ever occurred. They believe that the available data are too limited to conclude what the rate of death by suicide is among medical students compared to their age-matched peers. The authors speculate that the lack of accurate data may be related both to reluctance on the part of schools to report deaths by suicide, and to the failure of national organizations like the Association of American Medical Colleges, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and Liaison Committee on Medical Education to mandate reporting. The authors believe that without reliable data the medical education community will never be able to determine whether any trends or predictors are connected to medical student death by suicide and, as a result, intervening in a meaningful way will remain impossible. The authors call on the national organizing bodies of medical education to mandate reporting of deaths by suicide, and to create and maintain a database for tracking and studying these events. They advocate public access to unidentified data, linking medical schools to the number of deaths by suicide, as another method of creating accountability and influencing medical school behavior in addressing this tragic phenomenon.'",,,Muller,David,D,,"B.M.

Only studies reporting original data and containing sufficient demographic information to compute standard mortality rates (SMR) or crude suicide rates were analyzed and organized into single-site studies. Only 4 single-site studies had a higher suicide rate than the comparable populations. Multiple-site collaborative studies done in the United States since 1960 strongly suggest a campus student suicide rate significantly less than in the matched control population. However, deficiencies in case finding, case definition, sampling bias, and statistical techniques may place these conclusions in doubt. The author outlines research methods that might be applied to future multiple-site studies to resolve questions related to late adolescent and young adult suicidal behavior on campus and in other similar educational settings.'",,,Silverman,M M,MM,,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Chicago, IL 60637.",eng,,Review,,,England,Suicide Life Threat Behav,7608054,0363-0234,,,,0,0,ppublish,,8310467

Counting the cases reported as such to the university administration, a total of 65 students committed suicide during the 20 years from 1962 till 1981. This amounts to a yearly average of 25.6 cases per 100,000 students. A comparison of this quota with that of several Japanese and foreign universities is made. In 1970, the year in which the students unrest at the Japanese universities reached its peak, the frequency of the suicide fell to its all time low. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is proposed. Out of the 65 students who committed suicide, 25 (38%) have at least once visited the psychiatric clinic of the Tokyo University. In view of the high percentage of the mentally disturbed students in the total number of suicides, the importance of measures taken of foster the mental health of the students is stressed for reasons of suicide prophylaxis. The issue in most of these cases was the conflict between the required scholastic accomplishments and the failure of achieving them. The resulting frustration becomes the immediate motive of the suicide. Therefore, a more intensive psychiatric care of such students is recommended especially during the examination season from January till May, when in Japan the students are exposed to the highest psychological stress. Out of 25 mentally disturbed students who ended by committing suicide, 18 revealed their desire to die in a more or less expressed way already during the time of their psychiatric treatment or consultation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'",,,Ishikawa,K,K,,Psychiatric Research Institute of Tokyo.,ger,,Journal Article,,,Germany,Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr,8103137,0720-4299,,,,0,0,ppublish,,10.1055/s-2007-1001829

Fifty college students who had made suicide attempts were studied in detail over a 5-year period. Short term therapy was administered in most cases and long term therapy in some. Psychological tests (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test, Sentence Completion, Figure Drawing, and Word Association) were performed and used as an independent check on the data derived from the interviews. The study indicates the ways in which death has become a way of life for these students--an integral, ongoing part of their adaptation. It traces the origin of this adaptation in a family relationship that the students perceived as requiring their emotional extinction. These students are tied to their parents in a kind of death knot and have become overly suicidal when live--coming to college, graduating, becoming seriously involved with another person--threatens to unravel this knot.'",,,Hendin,H,H,,,eng,,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,United States,J Nerv Ment Dis,0375402,0022-3018,,,,0,0,ppublish,,1117292
