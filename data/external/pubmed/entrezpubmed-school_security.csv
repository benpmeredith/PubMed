The present study aims to identify the individual and familial characteristics associated with the incidents of child sexual abuse (CSA) in Turkey's school environment. The incidents involving school-related CSA constituted 5.6% (N=125) of 2,238 cases. The following was discovered: an adult committed the majority (64%) of CSA in the school environment; most adult perpetrators were teachers (62.5%). This study determined that the perpetrators manipulated the victims via methods that included physical abuse (11.2%), threats (19.2%), tricks/deception (15.2%), and taking photographs/videos with sexual content (3.2%); and CSA incidents involved intercourse (15.2%); and almost three-quarter of the victims of CSA in the school environment reported the incident late. This study indicates that peer perpetrators abuse younger victims and a greater proportion of male victims relative to adult perpetrators. In light of these findings, school security must be improved, especially in public schools, and trainings aimed at preventing bullying and sexual abuse (SA) should be given to all school staff, students, and parents.""",,,Yüksel,Fadime,F,,"b SB Atatürk Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,J Child Sex Abus,9301157,1053-8712,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1080/10538712.2018.1501787

Using two waves of data from the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002 (N=7659; 50.6% female; 56.7% White, 13.3% Black, 13.5% Hispanic, 11.3% Asian American, 5.4% other race), results from a series of multi-level models demonstrate that adolescents in schools with more security measures report higher odds of being threatened with harm, and no difference in odds of being in a physical altercation or having something stolen over time. Although prior research has established racial disparities in using school security measures, results demonstrate inconsistent patterns in the extent to which adolescents' race conditions the relationship between security and victimization. The findings are discussed in light of existing theoretical and empirical work, and implications for both research and practice are offered.""",,,Boman,John H,JH,,"Department of Sociology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH, 43403, USA. jboman@bgsu.edu.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,J Youth Adolesc,0333507,0047-2891,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1007/s10964-018-0818-5

It has been associated with serious incidents of school violence as well as detrimental physical, psychological, emotional, and social consequences for its victims. Given its consequences, it is crucial to understand who is more likely to be targeted for bullying victimization. This study examines whether a number of important factors such as gender, physical and interactionist school security measures, and involvement in extracurricular activities influence an individual's risk of bullying victimization from social bond and routine activity perspectives. The study employs the 2011 School Crime Supplement of the National Crime Victimization Survey to investigate the causes of bullying victimization. The results show that gender, interactionist school security measures, and extracurricular activities affect an individual's likelihood of bullying victimization.""",,,Keith,Shelley,S,,"2 Mississippi State University, Starkville, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,J Interpers Violence,8700910,0886-2605,,,,0,0,aheadofprint,,10.1177/0886260516672941

Yet, the role of school contexts in this relationship remains unclear. Nevertheless, school-based efforts to reduce victimization often focus on altering contexts without sufficient evidence of associations with improved student outcomes. School security measures constitute one such suite of contextual interventions aimed at reducing victimization. This study tested a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between multiple victimization and academic performance is mediated by absenteeism, and the relationship between multiple victimization and absenteeism is moderated by the presence of school security measures. Participants were 5930 (49.6% female and 79.51% White) 12- to 18-year-old adolescents from a national sample collected through the 2011 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey. Results of path analysis models indicated that the relationship between multiple victimization and academic performance was partially mediated by absenteeism, and that both metal detectors and security guards moderated the relationship between multiple victimization and absenteeism. Additional analyses revealed the utility of considering subpopulations of victims characterized by specific facets of their contexts.

This study examined how different patterns of visible security utilization were associated with U.S. middle and high school students' academic performance, attendance, and postsecondary educational aspirations. The data for this study came from two large national surveys--the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (N = 38,707 students; 51% male, 77% White, MAge = 14.72) and the School Survey on Crime and Safety (N = 10,340 schools; average student composition of 50% male, 57% White). The results provided no evidence that visible security measures had consistent beneficial effects on adolescents' academic outcomes; some security utilization patterns had modest detrimental effects on adolescents' academic outcomes, particularly the heavy surveillance patterns observed in a small subset of high schools serving predominantly low socioeconomic students. The findings of this study provide no evidence that visible security measures have any sizeable effects on academic performance, attendance, or postsecondary aspirations among U.S. middle and high school students.""",,,Fisher,Benjamin W,BW,,"Department of Human and Organizational Development, Vanderbilt University, Peabody #90, 230 Appleton Place, Nashville, TN, 37203, USA.",eng,,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,United States,J Youth Adolesc,0333507,0047-2891,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1007/s10964-015-0265-5
